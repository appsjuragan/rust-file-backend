## Alert Detail



### [ Cross-Domain Misconfiguration ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10098/)



##### Medium (Medium)

### Description

Web browser data loading may be possible, due to a Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) misconfiguration on the web server.

* URL: https://myfiles1.thepihouse.my.id/robots.txt
  * Node Name: `https://myfiles1.thepihouse.my.id/robots.txt`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `access-control-allow-origin: *`
  * Other Info: `The CORS misconfiguration on the web server permits cross-domain read requests from arbitrary third party domains, using unauthenticated APIs on this domain. Web browser implementations do not permit arbitrary third parties to read the response from authenticated APIs, however. This reduces the risk somewhat. This misconfiguration could be used by an attacker to access data that is available in an unauthenticated manner, but which uses some other form of security, such as IP address white-listing.`
* URL: https://myfiles1.thepihouse.my.id/sitemap.xml
  * Node Name: `https://myfiles1.thepihouse.my.id/sitemap.xml`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `access-control-allow-origin: *`
  * Other Info: `The CORS misconfiguration on the web server permits cross-domain read requests from arbitrary third party domains, using unauthenticated APIs on this domain.

Instances: 2

### Solution

Ensure that sensitive data is not available in an unauthenticated manner (using IP address white-listing, for instance).
Configure the "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" HTTP header to a more restrictive set of domains, or remove all CORS headers entirely, to allow the web browser to enforce the Same Origin Policy (SOP) in a more restrictive manner.

### [ Non-Storable Content ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10049/)



##### Informational (Medium)

### Description

The response contents are not storable by caching components such as proxy servers. If the response does not contain sensitive, personal or user-specific information, it may benefit from being stored and cached, to improve performance.

* URL: https://myfiles1.thepihouse.my.id/
  * Node Name: `https://myfiles1.thepihouse.my.id/`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `no-store`
  * Other Info: ``
* URL: https://myfiles1.thepihouse.my.id/robots.txt
  * Node Name: `https://myfiles1.thepihouse.my.id/robots.txt`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `no-store`
  * Other Info: ``
* URL: https://myfiles1.thepihouse.my.id/sitemap.xml
  * Node Name: `https://myfiles1.thepihouse.my.id/sitemap.xml`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `no-store`
  * Other Info: ``


Instances: 3

### Solution

The content may be marked as storable by ensuring that the following conditions are satisfied:
The request method must be understood by the cache and defined as being cacheable ("GET", "HEAD", and "POST" are currently defined as cacheable)
The response status code must be understood by the cache (one of the 1XX, 2XX, 3XX, 4XX, or 5XX response classes are generally understood)
The "no-store" cache directive must not appear in the request or response header fields
For caching by "shared" caches such as "proxy" caches, the "private" response directive must not appear in the response
For caching by "shared" caches such as "proxy" caches, the "Authorization" header field must not appear in the request, unless the response explicitly allows it (using one of the "must-revalidate", "public", or "s-maxage" Cache-Control response directives)
In addition to the conditions above, at least one of the following conditions must also be satisfied by the response:
It must contain an "Expires" header field
It must contain a "max-age" response directive
For "shared" caches such as "proxy" caches, it must contain a "s-maxage" response directive
It must contain a "Cache Control Extension" that allows it to be cached
It must have a status code that is defined as cacheable by default (200, 203, 204, 206, 300, 301, 404, 405, 410, 414, 501).
